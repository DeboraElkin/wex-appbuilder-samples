# wex-appbuilder-samples
This repository contains example widgets that can be used in [IBM Watson Explorer](http://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/explorer.html) Application Builder. These are real examples of custom widgets that have been built by IBMers for a demo or client implementation, and are shared to help you learn about what you can do with widgets and how.

For more information about how you could use these widgets in an Application Builder application, see [the WEX documentation](http://www-01.ibm.com/support/knowledgecenter/SS8NLW_11.0.0/com.ibm.swg.im.infosphere.dataexpl.appbuilder.doc/c_ab-wrapper.html).
